<p>Hi dear reader,</p>
<p>Let's start with a quick introduction. My name is Jon, and I was born a few decades ago in Oostende, a town on Belgium's North Sea coast. We did not live in Oostende however, I grew up in the nearby city of Bruges.</p>
<p>Bruges is a beautiful city but I was nevertheles always curious about what life was like elsewhere. As soon as I finished my studies I moved abroad; first to Izmir in Turkey and later to Barcelona in Spain.</p>
<p>When you're young and relatively free of responsabilities, Barcelona is one of the best places you can possibly be; it is young, bustling and international, and just has this natural feel-good aura. Barcelona is the city where I met my partner Julia and several of my best friends.</p>
<p>One thing Barcelona did lack however was a decent job market. The 2008 financial crisis had wrecked Spain's economy and unemployment levels stood at an all-time high, especially among the young. I worked a low paying customer support job until one day in 2013 I suddenly received an offer for a higher position and better salary. One small caveat in the contract was that the position was London based only though. We decided to take our chances and moved from Spain to the UK.</p>
<p>London does not have a beach, the climate is absolutely rubbish and so is the food. It is however a fantastic place to work. Living in London allowed us to save up for a mortgage (something we could not even dream of in Barcelona) and buy a small ex-council house in London's south-east borough of Greenwich. Shortly after moving to Greenwich Julia gave birth to our daughter Zoë and our son Adrian was born a few years later.</p>
<p>And that's when the itch to move again started to become stronger again. London might be a great place to work, but it is a terrible place to raise a family. Hospitals and schools are chronically underfunded and childcare is so expensive it usually makes more sense to just quit your job. Add to that the other reasons big cities are not ideal to raise a family (housing costs, polutions levels, crime rates, etc..) and you'll understand why shortly after Adrian's birth we decided to move again.</p>
<p>So that's why, on the 5th September 2022, almost seven years after moving from Spain to UK, we moved back from the UK to Spain. When we boarded the plane to Spain, we did not yet know were in Spain we would settle - all we knew was that we wanted to live close to Barcelona but not in Barcelona itself. A bit of internet research pointed to 'Vilanova i la Geltrú', a town 40 kilometers west of Barcelona, as a good base to start exploring Barcelona's surrounding towns and villages. We had booked an airbnb for 2 weeks in the heart of Vilanova's old town and would see how things evolved from there on.</p>
<p>Our internet research proved to be inaccurate though: Vilanova i la Geltrú was not just a good exploration base, it was an absolute gem of a town. Just big enough to have everything you need and just small enough to have everything within walking distance, Vilanova's town center oozes charm and liveliness and the Vilanovans themselves are friendly and welcoming. Add to that the mediterannean climate, the mediterannean cuisine, the proximity of the sea and beaches, the surrounding Garaff nature park, the closeness of the cities of Barcelona and Tarragona, the surrounding historic towns and villages, the convenience of train connections and a nearby airport, the nearby Pyrenees mountain range, ... and you can see why we quickly fell in love with Vilanova i la Geltrú.</p>
<p>I could not feel at fault for having underestimated Vilanova i la Geltrú though. I had been searching extensively for blogs, vlogs and travel guides both in English and in Spanish, but there was simply  very little information available online about the town.</p>
<p>It was this this lack of information about for a town that was quickly growing on me that sparked the idea for this blog. With Vilanovella I hope to do two things:<ul><li>Getting to know Vilanova i la Geltrú in detail, both as an inhabitant and as a visitor.</li><li>Sharing my experiences with others who might be interested in learning more about Vilanova i la Geltrú.</li></ul></p>
<p>So dear reader, follow me in my discovery of Vilanova i la Geltrú. I'm sure you'll enjoy the read as much as I'll enjoy the write.</p>
<p>Un abrazo,</p>
<p>Jon</p>
